BarcodeScanner
==============

cross-platform BarcodeScanner for Cordova / PhoneGap

follows the Cordova Plugin spec https://github.com/alunny/cordova-plugin-spec

so that it works with Pluginstall https://github.com/alunny/pluginstall

Note: the Android source for this project includes an Android Library Project.
pluginstall currently doesn't support Library Project refs, so its been
prebuilt as a jar library. Any updates to the Library Project should be
committed with an updated jar.
