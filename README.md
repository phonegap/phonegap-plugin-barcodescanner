# PhoneGap Plugin BarcodeScanner
================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/phonegap/phonegap-plugin-barcodescanner.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/phonegap/phonegap-plugin-barcodescanner)

Cross-platform BarcodeScanner for Cordova / PhoneGap.

Follows the [Cordova Plugin spec](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/plugin_ref/spec.html), so that it works with [Plugman](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugman).

## Installation


This requires phonegap 7.1.0+ ( current stable v8.0.0 )

    phonegap plugin add phonegap-plugin-barcodescanner

It is also possible to install via repo url directly ( unstable )

    phonegap plugin add https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-plugin-barcodescanner.git

Optional variables:
This plugin requires the Android support library v4. The minimum version is `24.1.0`. Default value is `27.+`.  Check out the latest version [here](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/support-library/revisions.html).
```
phonegap plugin add phonegap-plugin-barcodescanner --variable ANDROID_SUPPORT_V4_VERSION="27.1.1"
```
### Supported Platforms

- Android
- iOS
- Windows (Windows/Windows Phone 8.1 and Windows 10)
- Browser

Note: the Android source for this project includes an Android Library Project.
plugman currently doesn't support Library Project refs, so its been
prebuilt as a jar library. Any updates to the Library Project should be
committed with an updated jar.

Note: Windows 10 applications can not be build for `AnyCPU` architecture, which is default for Windows platform. If you want to build/run Windows 10 app, you should specify target architecture explicitly, for example (Cordova CLI):

```
cordova run windows -- --archs=x86
```

### PhoneGap Build Usage

Add the following to your config.xml:

```
<!-- add a version here, otherwise PGB will use whatever the latest version of the package on npm is -->
<plugin name="phonegap-plugin-barcodescanner" />
```
On PhoneGap Build if you're using a version of cordova-android of 4 or less, ensure you're building with gradle:
```
<preference name="android-build-tool" value="gradle" />
```

## Using the plugin ##
The plugin creates the object `cordova.plugins.barcodeScanner` with the method `scan(success, fail)`.

The following barcode types are currently supported:

|  Barcode Type | Android | iOS | Windows  |
|---------------|:-------:|:---:|:--------:|
| QR_CODE       |    ✔    |  ✔  |     ✔    |
| DATA_MATRIX   |    ✔    |  ✔  |     ✔    |
| UPC_A         |    ✔    |  ✔  |     ✔    |
| UPC_E         |    ✔    |  ✔  |     ✔    |
| EAN_8         |    ✔    |  ✔  |     ✔    |
| EAN_13        |    ✔    |  ✔  |     ✔    |
| CODE_39       |    ✔    |  ✔  |     ✔    |
| CODE_93       |    ✔    |  ✔  |     ✔    |
| CODE_128      |    ✔    |  ✔  |     ✔    |
| CODABAR       |    ✔    |  ✖  |     ✔    |
| ITF           |    ✔    |  ✔  |     ✔    |
| RSS14         |    ✔    |  ✖  |     ✔    |
| PDF_417       |    ✔    |  ✔  |     ✔    |
| RSS_EXPANDED  |    ✔    |  ✖  |     ✖    |
| MSI           |    ✖    |  ✖  |     ✔    |
| AZTEC         |    ✖    |  ✔  |     ✔    |

`success` and `fail` are callback functions. Success is passed an object with data, type and cancelled properties. Data is the text representation of the barcode data, type is the type of barcode detected and cancelled is whether or not the user cancelled the scan.

A full example could be:
```js
   cordova.plugins.barcodeScanner.scan(
      function (result) {
          alert("We got a barcode\n" +
                "Result: " + result.text + "\n" +
                "Format: " + result.format + "\n" +
                "Cancelled: " + result.cancelled);
      },
      function (error) {
          alert("Scanning failed: " + error);
      },
      {
          preferFrontCamera : true, // iOS and Android
          showFlipCameraButton : true, // iOS and Android
          showTorchButton : true, // iOS and Android
          torchOn: true, // Android, launch with the torch switched on (if available)
          saveHistory: true, // Android, save scan history (default false)
          prompt : "Place a barcode inside the scan area", // Android
          resultDisplayDuration: 500, // Android, display scanned text for X ms. 0 suppresses it entirely, default 1500
          formats : "QR_CODE,PDF_417", // default: all but PDF_417 and RSS_EXPANDED
          orientation : "landscape", // Android only (portrait|landscape), default unset so it rotates with the device
          disableAnimations : true, // iOS
          disableSuccessBeep: false // iOS and Android
      }
   );
```

## Encoding a Barcode ##

The plugin creates the object `cordova.plugins.barcodeScanner` with the method `encode(type, data, success, fail)`.

Supported encoding types:

* TEXT_TYPE
* EMAIL_TYPE
* PHONE_TYPE
* SMS_TYPE

```
A full example could be:

   cordova.plugins.barcodeScanner.encode(cordova.plugins.barcodeScanner.Encode.TEXT_TYPE, "http://www.nytimes.com", function(success) {
            alert("encode success: " + success);
          }, function(fail) {
            alert("encoding failed: " + fail);
          }
        );
```

## iOS quirks ##

Since iOS 10 it's mandatory to add a `NSCameraUsageDescription` in the `Info.plist`.

`NSCameraUsageDescription` describes the reason that the app accesses the user's camera.
When the system prompts the user to allow access, this string is displayed as part of the dialog box. If you didn't provide the usage description, the app will crash before showing the dialog. Also, Apple will reject apps that access private data but don't provide an usage description.

To add this entry you can use the `edit-config` tag in the `config.xml` like this:

```
<edit-config target="NSCameraUsageDescription" file="*-Info.plist" mode="merge">
    <string>To scan barcodes</string>
</edit-config>
```

## Windows quirks ##

* Windows implementation currently doesn't support encode functionality.

* On Windows 10 desktop ensure that you have Windows Media Player and Media Feature pack installed.
